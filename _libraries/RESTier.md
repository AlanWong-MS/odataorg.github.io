RESTier is a RESTful API development framework for building standardized, OData V4 based REST services on .NET. It can be seen as a middle-ware on top of Web API OData. RESTier can provide convenience to bootstrap an OData service and add business logic like what WCF Data Services does as well as flexibily and easy customization like what Web API OData does.
