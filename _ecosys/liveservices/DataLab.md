DataLab (formerly known as Open Government Data Initiative) provides a customizable API for publishing government open data. The OGDI project has been superseded by the DataLab project hosted on GitHub. DataLab provides a RESTful Web service for data, accessible and visualized via a native DataBrowser (ASP.NET MVC), web and mobile apps (HTML/JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, etc), Excel, SharePoint, Drupal 7 and others.
