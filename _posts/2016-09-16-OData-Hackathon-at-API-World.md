Progress DataDirect held the first known OData Hackathon this week at APIWorld 2016.

Participants built applications to integrate with voice assistant services like Microsoft Cortana 
and Amazon Alexa that used OData to pull and update data from Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics CRM and Sugar CRM.

The winners, Echo Jokes, used facial recognition from the Microsoft Cognitive Services API to evaluate 
jokes retrieved from Salesforce and Sugar CRMs using OData.

Other contestants built applications for homebuyers to find listings based on personality, and for executives 
to leverage Alexa as a real-time secretary to assist with customer leads.
